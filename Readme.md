# StealthPass Protocol Documentation

## Overview
StealthPass is an on-chain event ticketing platform designed for anonymous users, Web2 users, and Web3 users. It offers a seamless user experience comparable to platforms like Luma, leveraging advanced cryptographic techniques like Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Account Abstraction (AA) to ensure privacy and interoperability.

StealthPass enables event organizers to host events and users to securely purchase tickets while maintaining anonymity or interacting through traditional Web3 wallets. For anonymous users, StealthPass ensures that their identities are hidden while allowing seamless event participation.

## Problems Addressed

Anonymous users, such as developers attending ETHGlobal events, conferences, or Devcon, often face significant challenges when purchasing on-chain tokens for tickets. These challenges include:

1. **Identity Doxxing**:
   - At real-time events, users are required to reveal their real-world identities, which get mapped to their on-chain identities.
   - Many users rely on their on-chain profiles for sensitive consumer-centric transactions or subscriptions that they prefer to keep private.
   - Users holding significant funds face security risks and are reluctant to doxx themselves when attending these events.

2. **Lack of Composability with ZK-Based Solutions**:
   - Event organizers using ZK approaches cannot utilize ticket data for analytics or data markets due to the lack of user information.
   - ZK solutions prevent users from using their primary wallets for event interactions. For instance, users winning on-chain raffles cannot claim rewards due to the commitment-based model.
   - Proving tickets on-chain with ZK solutions is computationally expensive.

3. **Government Requirements for Confidential Access Control**:
   - Governments have shown interest in NFT-based event ticketing but require confidentiality and controlled access to data.

StealthPass addresses these issues by leveraging Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE):
   - It ensures user confidentiality while allowing composability for event organizers to utilize data within privacy-preserving constraints.
   - Users can securely use their main wallets to claim rewards and participate in on-chain activities.
   - It provides affordable and efficient ticket validation while meeting government standards for confidentiality and access control.

## Key Features

### 1. **Multi-User Support**
- **Web3 Users**: Standard wallet-based interaction.
- **Web2 Users**: Access via Account Abstraction (AA) and gasless transactions.
- **Anonymous Users**: Encrypted wallet addresses and secure ticket validation through FHE.

### 2. **Anonymity with FHE**
StealthPass uses Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to provide anonymity for users opting for the "Anon Ticket" option. This ensures:
- The encrypted holder address is stored on the blockchain.
- Ciphertext is securely stored on-chain using the Inco platform.
- Event organizers can verify encrypted tickets without revealing user identities.

### 3. **Decentralized Architecture**
- **EDU Chain Blockchain**: Stores encrypted holder addresses.
- **Inco Storage**: Functions as encrypted on-chain storage, similar to IPFS but with privacy-preserving capabilities.
- **Hyperlane SDK**: Ensures secure cross-chain messaging.

### 4. **Enhanced User Experience**
- Local wallet generation for ticket holding.
- Gasless transactions for Web2 users.
- Ticket details embedded in QR codes for easy verification.

### 5. **FHE Integration**
- User identity and ticket ownership verification via re-encryption calls provided by the Inco gateway.
- Composable cryptographic operations allow users to interact seamlessly across events, win lotteries, and more.

## Workflow

### User Journey

1. **User Registration**:
   - Connect a wallet using Privy (for Web3 users).
   - Generate a fresh wallet locally (for anonymous users).

2. **Ticket Purchase**:
   - Approve USDC transfer for the event contract.
   - Generate a pair of public and private keys for ticket holding.
   - Encrypt the public key using the `fhevmjs` SDK.

3. **Data Storage**:
   - The encrypted holder address is stored on EDU Chain.
   - Ciphertext is stored on-chain on Inco L1 via Hyperlane SDK.

4. **QR Code Generation**:
   - A QR code is generated containing:
     - EIP-712 signed message.
     - Hash of ticket information.

5. **Verification**:
   - The event organizer uses Incoâ€™s re-encrypt functionality to securely verify ticket ownership.
   - Cross-checks the QR code, signature, and ticket information.

### Organizer Workflow

1. Deploy an event contract on EDU Chain blockchain.
2. Specify event details (e.g., name, ticket price, location).
3. Verify attendee tickets by using re-encryption calls and comparing against QR code data.
4. Conduct raffles or special activities using encrypted ticket data.

## Why EDU Chain Blockchain is a Key Choice

EDU Chain Blockchain plays a pivotal role in the StealthPass Protocol by serving as the backbone for storing essential credentials such as NFTs, USDC, and user-specific data. While Inco is utilized as an encrypted IPFS-like gateway for secure on-chain data storage, EDU Chain ensures on-chain accessibility and integrity. Moreover, EDU Chain's composability allows encrypted keys and data to be used in advanced computations, enabling unique features like secure identity management and future data retrieval without compromising privacy. By combining EDU Chain's robust blockchain capabilities with Inco's privacy-focused encrypted storage, StealthPass provides a seamless and secure user experience.

- **Composability**:
  - FHE allows cryptographic operations to be performed directly on encrypted data.
  - Enables seamless interoperability across events.

- **Identity Reusability**:
  - Users can reuse their encrypted addresses (eAddresses) for interactions within an event.
  - Supports advanced functionalities like prize distribution or anonymous messaging.

- **Flexibility**:
  - EDU Chain contracts can access unique keys and perform computations.
  - Users can retrieve results in the future without revealing sensitive data.

## Smart Contract Design

### Protocol Architecture and User Flow

StealthPass's architecture leverages the combined power of EDU Chain Blockchain, Inco's encrypted storage, and Hyperlane's cross-chain messaging to create a seamless event ticketing experience. The protocol's user flow ensures a smooth interaction for organizers and attendees, from ticket purchases to verifications:

1. **User Registration**: Users can connect wallets using Privy or generate local wallets for anonymous interactions.
2. **Ticket Storage**: Credentials, such as NFTs and USDC, are securely stored on EDU Chain Blockchain. Encrypted ticket data is offloaded to Inco, functioning as an IPFS-like storage but with enhanced privacy features.
3. **Verification Process**: During verification, the organizer uses re-encryption calls via the Inco gateway to validate encrypted credentials. This ensures privacy while enabling seamless event access.
4. **Composable Computations**: EDU Chain Blockchain enables advanced computations with encrypted data, allowing features like lotteries, identity management
